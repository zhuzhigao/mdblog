In the past several years, I have kept learning and practising new technologies. There were one year or two I slowed down a little bit because I took the role of manager and spent most of the time improving my management skills. 

Though I didn't record all that I learned (or more accurately for most of them I just keep the notes on books and pdfs:-)), I do have some that were stored on my computer and my google drive. It is time to organize them in a proper way, as part of my knowledge repository, and the memento of the learning experience.
